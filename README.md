## Introduction

This is an analysis of Netflix's Content Strategy. The dataset was obtained from [here](https://statso.io/netflix-content-strategy-case-study/). This analysis was done to gain insight into how Netflix content is created, released, distributed, and consumed to achieve specific goals, such as maximizing audience engagement, viewership, brand reach, or revenue. The dataset contains 6 columns and 24812 rows. After a brief overview of the dataset, it was discovered that only the 'Release Date' column contained some missing values, which account for about a third of the entire contents of that column. However, these missing values were not treated in this analysis as they did not directly affect the analysis.

## Viewership by Content

The visualization indicates that shows dominate the total viewership hours on Netflix in 2023 compared to movies. This suggests that Netflix’s content strategy leans heavily toward shows, as they tend to attract more watch hours overall.

## Viewership by Language Group

The visualization reveals that English-language content significantly dominates Netflix’s viewership, followed by other languages like Korean. It indicates that Netflix’s primary audience is consuming English content, although non-English shows and movies also have a considerable viewership share, which shows a diverse content strategy.

## Viewership by Month

The graph compares viewership trends between movies and shows throughout 2023. It shows that shows consistently have higher viewership than movies, peaking in December. Movies have more fluctuating viewership, with notable increases in June and October. This indicates that Netflix’s audience engages more with shows across the year, while movie viewership experiences occasional spikes, possibly linked to specific releases or events.

## Viewership Across Seasons

The graph indicates that viewership hours peak significantly in the Fall season, with over 80 billion hours viewed, while Winter, Spring, and Summer each have relatively stable and similar viewership around the 20 billion mark. This suggests that Netflix experiences the highest audience engagement during Autumn.

## Content Releases and Viewership Hours Across Months

While the number of releases is relatively steady throughout the year, viewership hours experience a sharp increase in June and a significant rise in December, despite a stable release count. This indicates that viewership is not solely dependent on the number of releases but influenced by the timing and appeal of specific content during these months.

## Content Releases and Viewership Hours Across Days of the Week

The graph highlights that most content releases occur on Fridays, with viewership hours also peaking significantly on that day. This suggests that Netflix strategically releases content toward the weekend to maximize audience engagement. The viewership drops sharply on Saturdays and Sundays, despite some releases, indicating that the audience tends to consume newly released content right at the start of the weekend, which makes Friday the most impactful day for both releases and viewership.

## Viewership on Special Days

The data reveals that Netflix has strategically released content around key holidays and events. Some of the significant releases include:

1. New Year’s Period: Kaleidoscope: Limited Series was released close to New Year’s Day, resulting in high viewership.
2. Valentine’s Day: Perfect Match: Season 1 was released on February 14th, which aligns with a romantic theme and capitalizes on the holiday’s sentiment.

## Conclusion

Netflix's content strategy maximises viewership through targeted release timing and content variety. Shows consistently outperform movies in viewership, with significant spikes in December and June, indicating strategic releases around these periods. The Fall season stands out as the peak time for audience engagement. Most content is released on Fridays, which aims to capture viewers right before the weekend, and viewership aligns strongly with this release pattern. While the number of releases is steady throughout the year, viewership varies, which suggests a focus on high-impact titles and optimal release timing over sheer volume.
