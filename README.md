The data reveals that Netflix has strategically released content around key holidays and events. Some of the significant releases include:

1. New Year’s Period: Kaleidoscope: Limited Series was released close to New Year’s Day, resulting in high viewership.
2. Valentine’s Day: Perfect Match: Season 1 was released on February 14th, which align with a romantic theme and capitalize on the holiday’s sentiment.

## Conclusion

Netflix's content strategy maximises viewership through targeted release timing and content variety. Shows consistently outperform movies in viewership, with significant spikes in December and June, indicating strategic releases around these periods. The Fall season stands out as the peak time for audience engagement. Most content is released on Fridays, which aims to capture viewers right before the weekend, and viewership aligns strongly with this release pattern. While the number of releases is steady throughout the year, viewership varies, which suggests a focus on high-impact titles and optimal release timing over sheer volume.
